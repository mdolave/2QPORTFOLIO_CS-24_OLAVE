    <h2>Republic Act No. 10708: Tax Incentives Management and Transparency Act</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;">
        This law establishes a system for reporting and managing tax incentives given to 
        businesses. Leni Robredo authored this to promote fiscal accountability and 
        transparency in the grant of tax incentives by developing clear means in analyzing 
        its economic impacts, which will optimize the social benefit of such incentives. 
        Under this law, it is mandated that "all registered business entities are required 
        to file their tax returns and pay their tax liabilities, on or before the deadline 
        as provided under the Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)."

    <h2>Republic Act No. 10922: The Economic and Financial Literacy Act</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;">
        This law declares the second week of November as Economic and Financial Literacy 
        Week annually. This is crucial in raising national awareness about economic and 
        financial literacy by mandating government agenicies and youth organizations to 
        conduct activities or integrate financial topics into the academoc curriculum. 
        In our country deeply saddened by poverty, fostering sound financial decisions 
        which improve the economy should be of utmost importance. Under this Republic Act, 
        it is written that "the State recognizes the growth potential of the country through 
        a financially literate people."

    <h2>House Bill No. 19: Full Disclosure Bill</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;">
        Robredo filed this on her first day as a lawmaker. Should this bill have been 
        passed into law, all national and local government agencies would have to publicly 
        disclose all information on budget allocations and financial transactions. Under 
        this bill, all government agencies must adhere "instead of merely issuing a 
        statement of income and expenses."
