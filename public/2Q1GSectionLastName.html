        </a>
        , Leni Robredo served as the Representative for the 3rd District of Camarines Sur 
        in the 16th Congress from 2013 to 2016. During her single term as a lawmaker, she

        Republic Act No. 10708: Tax Incentives Management and Transparency Act
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;">
        This law establishes a system for reporting and managing tax incentives 
        given to businesses. Leni Robredo authored this to promote fiscal accountability 
        and transparency in the grant of tax incentives by developing clear means in 
        analyzing its economic impacts, which will optimize the social benefit of 
        such incentives. Under this law, it is mandated that "all registered business 
        entities are required to file their tax returns and pay their tax liabilities, on 
        or before the deadline as provided under the Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)."

        Republic Act 10922: The Economic and Financial Literacy Act
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;">
        This law declares the second week of November as Economic and Financial Literacy 
        Week annually. This is crucial in raising national awareness about economic and 
        financial literacy by mandating government agenicies and youth organizations to 
        conduct activities or integrate financial topics into the academoc curriculum. 
        In our country deeply saddened by poverty, fostering sound financial decisions 
        which improve the economy should be of utmost importance. Under this Republic Act, 
        it is written that "the State recognizes the growth potential of the country through 
        a financially literate people."

        House Bill No. 19: Full Disclosure Bill
    </h2>    
    <p style="font-size: larger; text-align: justify; text-indent: 50px;">
        Robredo filed this on her first day as a lawmaker. Should this bill have been passed into law, 
        all national and local government agencies would have to publicly disclose all information on 
        budget allocations and financial transactions. Under this bill, all government agencies must adhere
        "instead of merely issuing a statement of income and expenses."
